# Beef Jerky Mod (Fabric) (Minecraft 1.16.0+)

Beef Jerky can be created by putting some rotten flesh into a smoker to help purify it and transform it into edible jerky, without any nasty poison effects!

## Downloads

As a general warning, Remember to backup your world before installing new versions! Though really, it's a small mod and shouldn't break anything.

## Why this?

One of my YouTube subscribers requested that I create this. So I did! It's a simple mod, but it fills a need. Nom Nom!
